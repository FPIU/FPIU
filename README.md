I am a 16 y.o nonbinary who's goal is to learn java development to become extra epic.

A little more about me:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my very own YouTube and Twitch channels
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Ğ¡Ğ¾mfÑƒ#0860 (Discord)
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: They/Them
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've never seen snow before.

I have a public repository where I posted everything I've learned about spigot development so far. Don't expect much!
